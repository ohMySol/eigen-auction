/// One Settler is deployed per chain. Each `EigenAuctionHook` registers it via `setSettler`.
/// The AVS-committed winning operator calls `settle(key, arb, intents)` once per pool per block.
///
/// Step 1 — Top-of-block arb rebalance.
/// A single swap that moves the pool to the external price. The hook skims the operator's
/// committed bid from the output and distributes it to in-range LPs via the reward-growth accumulator.
///
/// Step 2 — User intent fills.
/// Each signed `SwapIntent` is signature-verified, pool-checked, and filled at the post-arb price.
/// Users bypass the public mempool entirely; their intents are delivered to the operator's private RPC.
///
/// Both steps execute inside a single Uniswap V4 flash-accounting unlock, so all token flows
/// are atomic and revert together on any failure.
///
/// Fallback
/// --------
/// If no settlement lands for `FALLBACK_PERIOD` consecutive blocks, the hook re-opens that pool
/// to unrestricted public swaps, preventing the venue lock from becoming a liveness failure.
